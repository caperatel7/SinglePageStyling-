# SinglePageStyling- For this assignment I wanted to demonstrate that I can create a page component that was scalable and concise where other developers could come and easily manage and duplicate the content of my work. 


From the template I divided the page into two main containers. the top half to contain the header, opening body paragraph, and intro photo. With the bottom half containing the pages remaining content. I utilized the capabilities of flexbox to create responsive, adaptive layouts to center content within the different divs to align them in rows and columns. Utilizing flex wrap for the potential different screen sizes. This allowed the flex items to wrap onto multiple lines in case the containers were not big enough to fit all the items in a single line. 

I Utilize the media queries to check for conditions in terms of width and height of the viewpoints.  as well as setting breakpoints at 425 px to encompass most mobile devices, 768px to account for tablets. I wanted to create scalable clean CSS from scratch without using bootstrap. As well as utilizing and naming my classes with precision accurately.
